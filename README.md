# Michael Bleigh's Presentation Decks

This repository contains the source for various presentations that
I've given or plan to give at some point. They are built using the
[quick-deck](https://github.com/divshot/quick-deck) precompiler
for [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

You can view the decks at http://decks.mbleigh.com/ (they are hosted
on [Divshot](http://www.divshot.com) in case you're curious).
